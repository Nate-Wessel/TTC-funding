# Purpose

This repository is for organizing and sharing data related to the funding and operations of the Toronto Transit Commission. It focuses specifically on developing a [longitudinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data)/historical database from a variety of reliable sources. Some incidental data like a consumer price index are included as well. 

If you have data or some other primary source not given here, I would _love_ it if you reached out via [email](mailto:nate@natewessel.com) or created a pull request.

# Formats
Some data are best provided year by year, i.e. standard panel data, while others e.g. fare changes are better recorded as a set of transition points.
In either case, I am entering data first in [what I hope is a nicely formatted spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gWv1bDCJZJsG3G6BQchv07gDrGD47f3pMxWifyRC5LI/edit?usp=sharing), and then later once that becomes fairly complete, simplifying it into a CSV so it's easier to work with.

# Sources
Sources, if referenced in a spreadsheet, may be identified by their numbers in the list below. 
If citing something new, please make a copy of it in some relatively stable format (e.g. PDF, XML, PNG screenshot) and bring it into this repository to prevent link rot. Include a date in the file name with the format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY at the very least.
