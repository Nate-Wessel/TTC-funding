# Purpose

This repository is for organizing and sharing data related to the funding and operations of the Toronto Transit commission. It focuses specifically on developing a [longitudinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data)/historical database from a variety of reliable sources. Some incidental data like a consumer price index is included as well. If data for other agencies are available, it may well expanded to include e.g. GO transit or other GTA transit operators. 

If you have data or a primary source not given here, I would _love_ it if you reached out or created a pull request.

# Formats
Some data are best provided year by year, i.e. standard panel data, while others e.g. fare changes are better recorded as a set of transition points. 
In either case, I am entering data first in what I hope is a nicely formatted spreadsheet, and then later once that becomes fairly complete, simplifying it into a CSV so it's easier to work with.

# Sources
Sources, if referenced in a spreadsheet, may be identified by their numbers, below. 
If citing something new, please make a copy of it in some relatively stable format (e.g. PDF, XML, PNG screenshot) and bring it into this repository to prevent link rot. Include a date in the file name with the format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY at the very least.
