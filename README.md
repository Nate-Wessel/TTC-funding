# Purpose

This repository is for organizing and sharing data related to the funding of the Toronto Transit commission, including historical fare rates. It compiles data from multiple sources and time periods. Pull requests with new data sources or corrections/updates are more than welcome. 

# Sources
Sources, if referenced elsewhere, should be identified by number. If citing something, please make a copy of it and bring it into this repository to prevent link rot. Include a date in the file name with the format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY at the very least.
